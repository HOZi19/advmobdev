WEEK 3 Activity : Advanced Navigation 

<img width="1170" height="2532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c37b1e5a-39d8-4cc1-bfc7-24796ec29cd7" />
The app integrates full swipe gesture support for drawer navigation with edge detection and swipe distance thresholds to ensure smooth opening and closing. Transition animations use Reanimated’s useDrawerProgress to apply scaling, translation, and dynamic border-radius effects for polished screen transitions. Navigation state is persistently stored via AsyncStorage, allowing the app to restore the last visited screen and drawer state even after restart. Validation and cleanup logic ensure corrupted saved data does not disrupt navigation flow.



Week 4: State Management Activity 1 -  (Spotify Playlist Builder App)

Week 4 Activity 2 - (Spotify Profile Creation Form) 

<img width="1170" height="2532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0624bde8-9e35-460b-ad8d-b31518fe3b41" />
Simple tap and gesture-based interactions are used in the playlist builder and profile panels to add, remove, or rearrange things as well as enter user data. Reanimated button, modal, and fade animations produce seamless visual changes throughout the user interface. To preserve user progress, AsyncStorage keeps track of playlist data, history stacks, and profile information independently. Every action is recoverable between app sessions thanks to the playlist's fully stored undo/redo feature.


Week 5: (Device Features)

Act 1: Theme Switcher 
<img width="1170" height="2532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c910aea-cae3-46ba-a6f5-70f0f0957124" />

<img width="1170" height="2532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb3ec361-8a5f-458a-8617-44015c9f2065" />

Act 2: (Camera with Filters)

<img width="1170" height="2532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/846217af-c0a6-4dc9-843e-b6adc9e0998f" />

The camera app uses advanced PanResponder gestures for filter sliders, dragging, and crop adjustments, enabling precise and responsive editing controls. Animated transitions enhance both theme switching and filter application, providing smooth visual feedback throughout the UI. Theme settings—light, dark, or custom—are saved through Redux Toolkit with AsyncStorage integration to ensure preferences persist across sessions. Filter previews and editing animations create a dynamic and engaging user experience.


Week 6: Location-Based Map Features

<img width="1170" height="2532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d5289e-96b9-452f-9067-6360ff5fc792" />

The map screen uses native map gestures such as zoom, pan, and marker selection, along with tap interactions for switching layers and handling permissions. Transitions between map types are visually smooth, complemented by animated markers and region movements when focusing on specific locations. Geofencing visuals update dynamically as the user moves, providing real-time feedback on proximity to key areas. While focused on live location tracking rather than storage, map preferences can be extended for future persistence.
